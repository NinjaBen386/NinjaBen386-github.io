WHile I was doing the course i found that my mindset was always wanting to carry on and then when i got stuck i found, when i got it i had a feeling of amazememt and then all of the sudden i was going for like two hours straight. 
I found that i absolutely enjoyed the course and would cetainly do the diploma course.
One of the stuents reached out to me to ask for my help becuase they were stuck doing the software devolopment project and they were confused on what Roman wanted to us to do. 
i gave them a helping hand and then they also gave me some help. 
another one of the students i ended chatting to alot, even during the lectures and we would always ask each other for help.
